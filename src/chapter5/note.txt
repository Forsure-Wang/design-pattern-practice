The Single Responsibility Principle
— Classes should have a single responsibility and thus only a single reason to change.

The Open/Closed Principle
— Classes and other entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

--->The Dependency Inversion Principle
— High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g. interfaces).
  Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.

--->The Liskov Substitution Principle
— Objects should be replaceable by their subtypes.

The Interface Segregation Principle
— Interfaces should be client specific rather than general.

The Dependency Inversion Principle
— Depend on abstractions rather than concretions.
